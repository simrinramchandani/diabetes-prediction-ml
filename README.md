# Diabetes Prediction ML Project

This project applies machine learning models to predict diabetes using real-world health data. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model evaluation using SVM, k-NN, and decision trees.

## 📊 Tools & Languages
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Files
- `DS3000.A11.Simrin.Ramchandani.ipynb`: Full notebook with code and analysis
- `diabetes.csv`: Input dataset

## 📌 Key Highlights
- Cleaned and explored patient data
- Built and compared SVM, k-NN, and tree-based models
- Evaluated model accuracy and confusion matrices


This project was part of Northeastern’s DS3000 coursework.
